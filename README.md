# Handwritten-digit-recognition-MNIST
Handwritten digit recognition using MNIST dataset with the help of Artificial Neural Network. It detects the scanned images of handwritten digits.

# MNIST dataset
MNIST is a collection of handwritten digits from 0-9. Image of size 28 X 28

# Code Requirements
1. Numpy
2. Tensorflow
3. Keras

# Description
Using various machine learning techniques, I created a handwritten digit recognition system. Data preprocessing, feature extraction, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning were completed through rigorous exploration and experimentation. The ability of artificial neural networks (ANNs) to accurately identify handwritten digits and the remarkable advances they bring to the realm of computer vision
